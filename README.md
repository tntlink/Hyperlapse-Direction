# Maps vs. 4x Hyperlapse:
# An Evaluation of Direction Giving Methods 
In this article we compare two methods of direction-giving: maps versus Micorosftâ€™s Hyperlapse 4x video. 
To evaluate the merit of each method we measure various user experience indicators. The results show that Hyperlapse is preferred by a majority of users and that it reduces the average time required to reach a location. 

Here contains the prototypes in for both map and hyperlapse directions in web and Android app.
